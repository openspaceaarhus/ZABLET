okay.
So you're stuck.

Read this..

"make full" should solve all your problems .. 

Device ID: 0x000000 ?? -> Did you do "make burn-fuse" ?

how to do the text: Easiest way is to run "./mktext.sh <whatever>". if this doesn't work, try editing zablet.png



burn only text from whatever.png:

"make whatever.eeprom.hex"

if this doesnt work, rename whatever.png to zablet.png and do a "make full" .. and stop thinking about it
