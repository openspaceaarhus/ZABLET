Zab-Let
-------

Zap all TVs in your neighborhood.

This project is a derivative of the Adafruit TV-B-Gone project and includes a
POV too. The Zab-Let device was successfully used in a soldering workshop for
newbies. Version 2 fixes a few problems and extends the firmware to include the
POV part as a default.
